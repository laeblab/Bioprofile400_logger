# Bioprofile400_logger
Script to read the serial data stream from the Bioprofile400 and record the data and convert it to XLSX files.

Connect Bioprofile to computer via "USB to Serial port" and then "serial to parallel" and then some sort of null modem thingy. There are different types of null models. You need the right one ;)
